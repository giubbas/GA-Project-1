## Brief
Gem the cloud is a reinterpretation of the Space Invaders arcade game. They both have a similar game logic. 

Gem is a cloud that likes good weather and doesn't want to be blown away by the storm. 
Help Gem clear the storm by hitting him with rainbow shots and be careful not to get hit by lightning!

## Technology used

### HTML
* **Basic structure composed by divs, buttons and headings**
* **Audio elements for background music and sound effects**

### CSS
* **Flex to arrange the elements**
* **Style the fonts**
* **Animate the "PLAY" button**

### Javascript
* **Create the grid**
* **Hold the key and buttons events**
* **Write the functions that make the game work**

## The approach taken

I immediately made the basic structure of html and css and I generated the game grid on javascript.

</p>

Than I moved on coding the game logic.
I first created Gem and enemies characters and gave them the possibility to move.
I made the Gem shots and I generated the lightning bolts by randomly selecting a shooter from the enemies that are still alive. 

Than I made coded the win and loose game logic and I displayed the result by an alert that shows up at the center of the screen.



Lastly I did the style with CSS and I drew the characters on pixilart.com. 
I wanted to give an old arcade style to the game so I made some pixel art graphics. 
I took the sounds effects and the background music from the internet.

## Challenges

Making Javascript was quite challenging. Generating enemy movement and hits was the hardest thing, as I expected, but also the addition of various features, such as the "quit" and the "sound/sound-off" buttons and the possibility of being able to restart the game, proved to be tricky to implement. 

## Key learnings
* **Learned how to disabled buttons after they are clicked**
* **Learned how to use the setInterval()**
* **I got more familiar with the chrome inspector**
* **Learned how to track the character's positions and store it in a variable**

## Conclusions

One of the greatest satisfactions is being able to create something you have imagined. 

I had fun.
Coding is great!
