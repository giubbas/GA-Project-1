GEM - The cloud

Gem is a cloud that likes good weather and doesn't want to be blown away by the storm. 
Help Gem clear the storm by hitting him with rainbow shots and and be careful not to get hit by lightning!


<!-- REALIZATION -->

Gem the cloud is a is a reinterpretation of the Space Invaders arcade game. They both have a similar game logic. 

Making Javascript was quite challenging. Generating enemy movement and hits was the hardest thing, as I expected, but also the addition of various features, such as the "quit" and the "sound/sound-off" buttons and the possibility of being able to restart the game, proved to be tricky to implement. 
One of the greatest satisfactions is being able to create something you have imagined. 

Lastly I did the graphics. 
I wanted to give an old arcade style to the game so I made some pixel art graphics. 
I drew the characters and the rainbow strokes on pixilart.com and then I got the background images on the internet.

It was fun,
coding is great!
